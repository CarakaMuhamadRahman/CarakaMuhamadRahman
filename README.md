### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Let me introduce Myself, my name is <strong>Caraka Muhamad Rahman</strong>.

I'm a Bachelor of Computer Science, graduate at the Universitas Komputer Indonesia.
I'm a Data Enthusiast who always learn to process data, both structured data and unstructured data. However, my focus is to process unstructured data especially **text**. Which is what made me do research in the field of **Artificial Intelligence** spesifically **Natural Language Processing(NLP)** to detect sarcasm in public comments towards politicians in Indonesia in my undergraduate thesis, using **Bi-LSTM** Algorithm for Classification and **SMOTE** for Oversampling.
